## 📋 Overview

Futunurse is an AI-powered study companion I built for nursing students. It tackles two of the biggest challenges in nursing school – creating care plans and prepping for the NCLEX – with smart, intuitive tools that actually make studying easier.
This project showcases modern web development practices with a focus on responsive design, performance optimization, and AI integration. Built to work seamlessly across all devices because real students need tools that fit their busy schedules.
